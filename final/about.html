            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <section id="me">
                <p>My name is Michael Shoaf. I am 27 years old and was born and raised in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area. Growing up I have always been in the music field with choirs and band. I grew up singing boy soprano most of my elementary years and switched to alto, by preference, during my 6th and 7th grade years. During 8th grade and higher, I settled in to a tenor role, mainly because the choir directors saw that boys should "sing with boys". This followed me until I forced myself to a bass role in 11th grade, of which I was not very qualified for range wise. I have since classified myself as a tenor, more lyrical or even heldentenor at times. </p>
                <p>In the year 2011, I had an opportunity to take private lessons with Dr. Joseph Banouch of Indiana University of Pennsylvania. In those lessons he addressed the opportunities I could have as a countertenor and what it means to have a voice like mine. From that point I started looking up anything dealing with countertenor. During the years of 2013-2015, I took a break from the music world to serve a volunteer church mission. I discovered during these years my passion for the arts and what my voice could be, I was still singing as a tenor. Since then I have been studying the voice type of countertenor at Brigham Young University, Idaho with Audrey Lambert, mezzo-soprano and spinto soprano. </p>
