        <h1>Target Audience</h1>
        <h2>WalMart</h2>
        <img alt="WalMart Mobile Screenshot" src="wmss.png" width="300pt">
        <p>Positive website used was: <a href="http://www.walmart.com">walmart.com</a></p>
        <p>1. Some demographics for this site are: Age: 20-60; Income: Lower Middle Class to Wealthy; Education: Any; Geographic Location: Anywhere</p>
        <p>2. It met my needs by being simple, effective, and to the point with goods I was looking for that day. I was able to search for my goods with the search bar at the top. I was able to click on the items and see whether they or other stores nearby had that item.</p>
        <p>3. The content was organized in a way that I could filter and refine my search to my preferences. It also kept the search bar, logo, for home page access, and the menu module at the top so you could always get back easily to it.</p>
        <p>4. The site made my mobile experience enjoyable by being consistent in its delivery of simplicity. I was able to go from product to product easily by using the search bar and refining the search to match exactly what I wanted within just a few touches of the screen.</p>
        <p>5. Yes, the site did facilitate to people in a mobile enviroment. It did so by never having me zoom in or out to experience the view of the product. It also optimized its view to make sure nothing was cramped together and laying overtop of one another. It facilitated menus that were clickable and by which you could scroll through.</p>
        <h1>Persona</h1>
        <img alt="Ricky Bobby" src="rickybobby.jpg" width="300pt">

        <h1>Site Contrast</h1>
        <p>1. I believe that they knew who their audience was. Although I used a search in my image, they are focused on those that need products for lower prices.</p>
        <p>2. They did meet their needs for their target audience. They provided a easy and friendly navigation on a mobile device to work well with the user's purchasing needs.</p>
        <p>3. They organized content in menus and lists that were easy to be found. </p>
        <p>4. Walmart did facilitate a mobile environment for their customers to use. </p>
        <p>A site that did very poorly at this, unfortunately, would be our schools website. I use that site quite frequently so I kept getting agitated by it.</p>
        <p>It can be found here: <a href="https://my.byui.edu/ics">BYU-Idaho Student Page</a></p>
