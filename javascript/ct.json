        "what": "A countertenor is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is equivalent to that of the female contralto or mezzo-soprano voice types. The countertenor range is generally equivalent to a contralto range, extending from around G3 to D5 or E5, although a sopranist (a specific kind of countertenor) may match the soprano's range of around C4 to C6. Countertenors often are baritones or tenors at core, but rarely use this vocal range in performance. The countertenor voice type has a lower tessitura than the contralto or mezzo-soprano.",
        "whatmore": "The term first came into use in England during the mid-17th century, and was in wide use by the late 17th century. However, the use of adult male falsettos in polyphony, commonly in the alto range, was common in all-male sacred choirs for some decades previous, as early as the mid-16th century. During the Romantic period, the popularity of the countertenor voice waned and few compositions were written with that voice type in mind.",
        "whatmost": "In the second half of the 20th century, there was great interest in and renewed popularity of the countertenor voice, partly due to pioneers such as Alfred Deller, as well as the increased popularity of Baroque opera and the need of male singers to replace the castrati roles in such works. Although the voice has been considered largely an early music phenomenon, there is a growing modern repertoire",
        "hist": "In the Catholic Church during the Renaissance (15th-16th century), St Paul's admonition 'mulieres in ecclesiis taceant' ('let the women keep silence in the churches' â€“ I Corinthians 14:34) still prevailed, and women were banned from singing in church services. Countertenors, though rarely described as such, therefore found a prominent part in liturgical music, whether singing a line alone or with boy trebles or altos. (Spain had a long tradition of male falsettists singing soprano lines). However, countertenors were never used for roles in early opera, the rise of which coincided with the arrival of a fashion for castrati. Castrati were already prominent by this date in Italian church choirs, replacing both falsettists and trebles. In Italian opera, by the late seventeenth century castrati predominated, while in France, the modal high tenor, called the haute-contre, was established as the voice of choice for leading male roles.",
        "morehist": "Today, countertenors are much in demand in many forms of classical music. In opera, many roles originally written for castrati (castrated males) are now sung and recorded by countertenors, as are some trouser roles originally written for female singers. The former category is much more numerous, and includes Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice and many Handel roles, such as the name parts in Giulio Cesare and Orlando, and Bertarido in Rodelinda. Mozart also had castrati roles in his early operas, including Amintas in Il re pastore and Cecilio in Lucio Silla."
