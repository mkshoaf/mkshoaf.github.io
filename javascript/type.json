        "low": "This is the term that is sometimes used, especially in English churches, for what many people call a true 'countertenor' or 'alt' or 'contre-t√©nor.' Essentially, these are many who sing almost exclusively in their upper register. ",
        "high": "This is a breed that is becoming increasingly common. Assumably, there are hundreds of men in every country who have unusually high voices, many whose voices 'never broke'. Of course, this begins to blur the line between who are simply high male voices and who are 'natural castrati' (see below). In any case, these types of singers are less inhibited now to show their true colors, and they are often called upon to sing soprano arias and/or soprano castrati roles.",
        "lyric": "I really like the latter term, because these aren't ordinary tenors. They are high tenors, typically with light voices, who have virtually no registers or 'breaks' in their voices. This allows them to sing with an often androgynous tone, quite suitable for parts written for 'haute-contre', another name for this voice type. In many cases, though, these singers took such parts in the past, whereas, in more recent years, they may have been singing ordinary tenor or baritone parts.",
        "forced": "Alessandro Moreschi was reputedly the last 'created' castrato, though undoubtedly many exist yet today. Surely eunuchs are still created in many parts of the world, but generally not to become singers (the full story of eunuchs is beyond the scope of this site). There are, however, men whose hormones never fully allowed some secondary sex characteristics to develop, including their larynxes. For this reason, they can be called 'natural' or 'endocrinological' castrati."
