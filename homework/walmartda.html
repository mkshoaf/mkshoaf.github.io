        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>Walmart goes about using a sans serif approach. It bolds the information for the target audience that they feel is most important; i.e. prices and products. It uses a smaller unbolded font to compare prices. It also uses different colors to draw your attention in different way. Red, for example, is what you save. Red also states important, which is most likely why they used it for savings. It uses a capitalized approach to state other important things; i.e. FREE shipping. </p>
